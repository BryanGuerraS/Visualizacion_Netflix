1. Ask
what is the problem that we're trying to solve?
What is the purpose of this analysis?
What are we hoping to learn from it? 
2. Prepare
We need to be thinking about the type of data we need in order to answer the questions that we've set out to answer based on what we learned when we asked the right questions. 
3. Process
This is where you get a chance to understand its structure, its quirks, its nuances, and you really get a chance to understand deeply what type of data you're going to be working with and understanding what potential that data has to answer all of your questions.
4. Analyze
This is the point where we have to take a step back and let the data speak for itself. 
5. Share
All of this work from asking the right questions to collecting your data, to analyzing and sharing, doesn't mean much of anything if we aren't taking action on what we've just learned.
6. Act

•What is the relationship between the data life cycle and the data analysis process? How are the two processes similar? How are they different?

While the data analysis process will drive your projects and help you reach your business goals, you must understand the life cycle of your data in order to use that process. To analyze your data well, you need to have a thorough understanding of it. Similarly, you can collect all the data you want, but the data is only useful to you if you have a plan for analyzing it.

•What is the relationship between the Ask phase of the data analysis process and the Plan phase of the data life cycle? How are they similar? How are they different?

The Plan and Ask phases both involve planning and asking questions, but they tackle different subjects. The Ask phase in the data analysis process focuses on big-picture strategic thinking about business goals. However, the Plan phase focuses on the fundamentals of the project, such as what data you have access to, what data you need, and where you’re going to get it.
